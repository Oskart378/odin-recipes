        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This salsa chicken recipe is very easy and quick! Someone gave me this
             recipe a few years back, and it has become a household favorite.
              Depending on your taste, you can use mild, medium, or hot salsa.
             I usually serve it with Spanish rice and Mexican-style canned corn.</p>


        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons taco seasoning mix</li>
            <li>1 cup salsa</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sour cream (Optional)</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
                Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
                Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is tender and 
                juicy and the juices run clear, 25 to 35 minutes.</li>


            <li>Sprinkle chicken evenly with cheese. Continue baking until 
                cheese is melted and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes more. Top with 
                sour cream and serve. </li>
        </ol>
